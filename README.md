# DSND_Image_Classifier

### Project Overview

The main purpose of this project is to train a  image classifier to recognize different species of flowers.  

### Project Components

This project contains two main parts: Jupyter Notebook and Python App. 

1. Image Classifier notebook
   - **Image Classifier.ipynb**: This jupyter notebook shows the code and development of the image classifier.
   - The project is broken down into multiple steps:
     * Load and preprocess the image dataset
     * Train the image classifier on the image dataset
     * Use the trained classifier to predict image content
2. Python App
   - **Predict.py**: This Python script loads the data from a image folder. Then it uses the data  to train and tune a Deep Learning model.  Finally the model will be saved to checkpoint for further usage.
   - **Train.py**:  This Python script load and rebuild the model from checkpoint. Then it uses the model  to predict the class of a image from a image file.
